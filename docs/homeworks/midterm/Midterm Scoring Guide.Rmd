One of the most important tasks of any junior intern at a property management company is to develop reports on future investment possibilities. Rental prices can vary a lot depending on the various features of the apartment and on the quality of the building it is in. 

Your task is to imagine yourself as an intern at a property investment firm. You are tasked with writing a report to your boss that attempts to determine what are the factors that best predict rental prices. Your team will use this information to help plan future rental property acquisitions. 

In particular, you need to find specific factors that are associated rental price and create a high quality regression model with multiple variables that explains this relationship

## Specific requirements

* Save this document as a new document (Save As...) and rename it `US Property Report`.
* Rename the title of your report to `US Property Report`
* Delete the `Assignment instructions`, `Task`, `Specific requirements` and `Points of emphases` sections
* Final report should be about 1500 words
  + Maximum 6 graphs
  + Maximum 4 tables
  
* Suggested structure:
  + Introduction & literature review
  + Summary statistics
  + Regression model
  + Regression diagnostics
  + Interpreting coefficients
  + Conclusion

***There will be a midterm check to make sure you are making good progress due Sunday, September 12th at 11:59 pm***

You need to submit a relatively finished version fo the first two sections (`Introduction & literature review` and `Summary statistics`) by the Sunday deadline. The grade will be pass/fail. The submitted check does not have to be in its final form (you can modify it later if you choose) or be polished. However, both sections should be substantially complete - all code necessary to fulfill the requirements of the section included and all text necessary to meet the requirements written.

## Points of emphasis

* Your job as an analyst is to write a report analyzing what features of apartments you think cause higher rents. You should limit your focus to one response variable and maximum 4-5 predictor variables that you think are most important in your analyses. You can consider multiple, related models if you wish - models that share most predictor variables but differ by one or two minor variables. 

* Whether a variable should be included or not should be based on whether the variable is important in evaluating the question posed above. You a source or two relevant to answering the question to better help you select variables that you include in your analysis. 

* Do not exclude a variable just because it initially does not meet the regression requirements. However, consider carefully whether some variables are actually highly related to another predictor variable â€“ do not include several measures of the same basic concept (collinearity). In general, you want to start by picking the variables you think matter the most in determining rent price and then work to try to understand their relationship to rent. 

* You should focus your graphs and tables on that illustrating the most important information for drawing your conclusion. Choose your tables carefully such that they convey the key information needed to arrive at your conclusion. Do not make tables and graphs of irrelevant information or points that do not need discussing. Multiple graphs of the same type (for example, distribution plots) can be combined using the `gridExtra` command, but unrelated plots should be listed separately. 

* Make sure to also interpret the coefficients. You need to interpret the impact of a one unit change in the predictor variable on the response variable. You additionally need to examine whether changes in the predictor variables lead to a substantively large or small change in the predictor variable. One way to do this is examining whether changing the predictor variable from its Q1 to Q3 value leads to a large or small change in the response variable. You may want to make a table with this information.  

* Included in this package of files is an example midterm. Do not blindly copy the structure of the sample. It is a guide only. You should develop your own results and follow the instructions listed here first and then refer to the sample for guidance on formatting.

## Scoring guide

* Justification for selection of variables (**10 points**). Variable selection should be done on the basis of some high quality thinking and good justification should be provided. Points subtracted for not explaining why certain variables were included in the analysis or providing weak justification for why certain variables were included. Points also subtracted if the logic is unclear as to why a particular variable should be chosen as a response variable.

* Understanding of variable distribution (**15 points**). Good quality description of distributions, including noting the four characteristics described in the textbook: center, shape, spread, and outliers. If any of these characteristics show problems, a discussion should included about what possible remedies (if any) can be considered for the distribution. Points subtracted for not usefully summarizing the distributions and incomplete summaries of the distribution.

* Appropriate regression model (**25 points**). You need to have a multiple regression model (two or more predictor variables). Conditions for regression should be checked, including straight enough condition, the equal variance assumption, and noting any outliers. These conditions should be checked via residual plots and partial residual plots. Points subtracted for not having a multiple regression model, for not checking the conditions or not checking them sufficiently, and for misinterpreting any plotted or tabular information. Note that you may have also added plots of two-way information about relationships between variables. 
  + It is acceptable to include simple two-way plots or correlations and describe them in your text but the main focus of your analysis should be on your multiple regression model.
  + If any of the regression conditions are violated, you should recognize the violation and suggest appropriate remedies in the text and show an updated model that meets the conditions (to the extent it is possible).

* Interpretation of regression model (**15 points**). You need to carefully interpret the meaning of your coefficients in your multiple regression model. You need to both describe the specific meaning of your regression coefficients in terms of a one-unit change in the predictor variable, but also interpret the magnitude of the coefficient in practical, meaningful terms (is the coefficient substantively large or small?). Points subtracted for not interpreting the coefficients, including the intercept, and points subtracted for not considering how meaningful the coefficients are.

* Overall strength of recommendation and evidence of logical thought (**15 points**). You should demonstrate a good understanding of the overall meaning of your findings and relate them to the task. Points subtracted if you do not relate your findings to the requested city, do not logically connect your findings, do not summarize your findings accurately or completely, or make a strong overall argument about your data.

* Graph and table quality (**10 points**). Graphs and tables are well labeled and relevant to your argument. Points subtracted for incomplete or inappropriate labeling, having too many graphs or tables, not having enough tables or graphs, or picking tables or graphs to include that do not show relevant or useful information. 

* Overall document presentation (**10 points**). Your writing was clear, the document was clean of any stray code, and the document was well organized. Points subtracted for unnecessary code in the document, poor organization, or difficult to read writing. While this document was not meant to be a research-quality paper, it should look professional.
