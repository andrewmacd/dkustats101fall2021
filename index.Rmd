# Course description

How can we use data to shed light on age-old and new human problems such as pollution, discrimination, and economic growth? How can we be “sure” that the evidence we have points us in the right direction? How meaningful are our findings? Do our results suggest the relationships we find between factors such smoking and cancer are meaningful or meaningless? How would we know? How should one properly display and explain your statistical results to these important issues?

This class introduces you to the tools and concepts that begin to tackle these questions. We will cover topics such as data summaries, sampling, data analysis, production of graphical displays, and regression techniques. The goal at the end of the course is that you will be able to conduct basic data manipulation, know how to properly summarize and display data, and make basic statistical inferences using real datasets. 

The emphasis in the course will not be on learning mathematical formulas related to statistics but rather to develop an intuitive understanding of statistical inference and measures of uncertainty. For those interested in developing this intuitive understanding of statistics in a more rigorous way, you may also consider taking the following courses:

* Math 205: the mathematical foundations of statistics
* Econ 203: advanced study of modern regression techniques
* Social Sciences 350: advanced statistical techniques applied to real-world problems

A third set of goals for the course is that you will also be able to read more fluently research literature that employs statistics. During this course I will reference, in class, a number of historically important academic articles and we will analyze the data from those articles. Doing so should help you understand how data is used (and misused) to construct social science arguments.
